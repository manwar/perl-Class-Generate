Revision history for Perl extension Class::Generate.

1.00	Original version; submitted to CPAN on 22 Sept 1999.  No regression
	tests included.

1.01	Submitted to CPAN on 8 Nov 1999.

	Bug fixes, primarily in passing parameters from a subclass'
	constructor to its superclass' constructor.

	Added options class_var, instance_var, check_code, and check_default.

	Added copy() and equals() methods.

1.02	Submitted to CPAN on 7 Dec 1999.

	New options and features aimed at optimizing modules to perform
	specific tasks without overhead of unused functions.

1.03	Submitted to CPAN 0n 3 Jan 2000.

	Added regression tests, and packaged according to accepted Perl style
	with a Makefile.pl.

	A Subclass may now access its parents' members in user-defined
	code as identifiers, not through methods.

1.04	Classes may now include protected members and methods, accessible in
	subclasses but not in the parent.

	Hash-based members have a new accessor: $o->delete_x(k) deletes
	key k from hash-based member x of instance o.

	The nocopy option for members improves control over the semantics
	of instance copying.

	A variable _cginfo has been added to each package.  Currently it is
	a scalar storing the class' base type.  Eventually it will contain
	information that will improve handling of classes saved to files.

	The regexps for testing the validity of a member name let some
	erroneous names slip by.  They have been corrected.

	A test for whether a subroutine name is known in a package was
	incorrectly implemented and sometimes resulted in a warning about an
	undefined value.  It's been fixed.

	The MIX parameter passing style wasn't implementing the checks for
	extraneous parameters correctly.

1.05	The class function can now be used to declare subclasses, just like
	C++.

	The mechanism for recording class declarations has been improved. It's
	been modularized, with functions that make classes saved to files
	understood when they're read back in.

1.06	Trailing semicolons are automatically appended to pre/post code if they
	were missing ("Do what I mean").

	Diagnostics have been improved.

	A subroutine delete_class() has been added, to encapsulate the
	operation of deleting a class.

1.07	Class::Generate now understands the warnings pragma in perl 5.8.
	This has been effected by adding several options: warnings, check_code,
	and check_params.

	The MIX parameter style wasn't working for classes with no positional
	parameters.

1.08	Class::Generate "uses" rather than "requires" Perl version 5.8.

1.09	Class::Generate now ensures that, during code-checking in a subclass,
	the code has access to the @ISA variable.

	A bug in recording constructor styles has been fixed.  This bug only
	matters for saved classes.
